Series-based resizing would be faster if implemented directly
Support < 24-bit BMP files, RLE compression
Multiple calls to resize() on PNG, GIF, BMP
Handle fixed-point overflow in GM fixed
Small memory leak in GIF, probably in libgif
Support new($file, $offset, $length) for images in audio files with latest Audio::Scan
png_set_expand_gray_1_2_4_to_8 not supported in libpng 1.2
Improve error handling, return 0, display good errors/warnings from libraries
Investigate libjpeg-turbo for x86 builds
Display library versions during Makefile.PL
Skip jpg/gif/png tests if library isn't supported

Tests:
  width/height all formats
  keep_aspect, both width/height padding
  Corrupt/invalid files in all formats, triggering longjmp's
  memory_limit
  PNG <8-bit gray

In buildme.sh static build script, could comment out optional libjpeg features to reduce library size:
  DCT_IFAST_SUPPORTED
  DCT_FLOAT_SUPPORTED (benchmark integer vs float DCT)
  INPUT_SMOOTHING_SUPPORTED
  C_PROGRESSIVE_SUPPORTED (we won't write progressive JPEG files)
  C_MULTISCAN_FILES_SUPPORTED (won't write them)
  BLOCK_SMOOTHING_SUPPORTED
  QUANT_1PASS_SUPPORTED
  QUANT_2PASS_SUPPORTED
  
Various PNG defines too, see pngconf.h
