bg_color option for resize() if useful?
Series-based resizing would be faster if implemented directly
Support < 24-bit BMP files, RLE compression
Multiple calls to resize() on PNG at least doesn't work
Handle fixed-point overflow in GM fixed
Small memory leak in GIF, probably in libgif
Update docs
keep_aspect support for GM
Support new($file, $offset, $length) for images in audio files, would require Audio::Scan update to report image offset
jpeg_mem_src not supported in libjpeg v6, need to use a custom source handler instead
png_set_expand_gray_1_2_4_to_8 not supported in libpng 1.2

Tests:
  width/height all formats
  keep_aspect, both width/height padding
  Corrupt/invalid files in all formats, triggering longjmp's
  memory_limit
  JPEG with 3 components

  JPEG w/ Exif normal orientation, 90, 180, 270, are the mirror ones ever used?
  JPEG w/ Exif big-endian (iPhone camera)
