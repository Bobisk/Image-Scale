Series-based resizing would be faster if implemented directly
Handle fixed-point overflow in GM fixed
Small memory leak in GIF, probably in libgif
BMP RLE support
BMP OS/2 format support
floating-point tests may fail on other platforms, should use fixed-point for all image comparison tests

Tests:
  Corrupt/invalid files in all formats, triggering longjmp's
  PNG <8-bit gray
