bg_color option for resize() if useful?
Series-based resizing would be faster if implemented directly
Input from memory (all formats)
GIF input
Clean up memory allocation, don't use DESTROY to free memory but do it directly
Support < 24-bit BMP files
Multiple calls to resize() on PNG at least doesn't work
Handle fixed-point overflow in GM fixed
Small memory leak in GIF, probably in libgif

Tests:
  width/height all formats
  Corrupt/invalid files in all formats, triggering longjmp's
  memory_limit
  JPEG with 3 components
  JPEG with 1 component (grayscale)
  PNG palette
  PNG gray
  PNG gray alpha
  PNG RGB
  PNG RGBA
  PNG interlaced
  PNG with tRNS
  GIF non-interlaced
  GIF transparent
  GIF interlaced
  Big-endian machines
